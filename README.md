# technopy
Good afternoon and welcome to technopy.
 
technopy is a Python package that allows you to control your TechnoTeam
Luminance Camera or Hyperspectral Camera. Once connected to the ActiveX
server, technopy will allow you to use most functionality directly from
within Python. This will open the LMK LabSoft4 Standard Color ActiveX
(ActiveX version of the software is needed), access the Calibration data,
control the camera to make measurements, analyze, save, etc.
